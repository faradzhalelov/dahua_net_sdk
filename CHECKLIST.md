## 🔄 Testing Checklist

### ⏳ To Be Tested (Requires Physical Device)
- [ ] Compile example app
- [ ] Run on physical Android device
- [ ] Connect to Dahua camera
- [ ] Verify video stream displays
- [ ] Test main stream (streamType=0)
- [ ] Test sub stream (streamType=1)
- [ ] Test PTZ control (if camera supports)
- [ ] Check native logs in Logcat
- [ ] Check Flutter console logs
- [ ] Test memory cleanup (connect/disconnect)
- [ ] Test multiple channels (if available)
- [ ] Test app suspend/resume
- [ ] Test release build
- [ ] Test on Android 5.0
- [ ] Test on Android 14
- [ ] Test on arm64-v8a device
- [ ] Test on armeabi-v7a device

### 🎯 Test Commands
```bash
# Clean build
cd example
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Run on device
flutter run

# Build APK
flutter build apk

# Install APK
flutter install

# Check logs
adb logcat | grep -E "DahuaSdk|NetSDK|PlaySDK"
```

## 🎯 Final Status

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Code Implementation | ✅ | All Java classes created |
| Build Configuration | ✅ | Kotlin removed, Java configured |
| File Structure | ✅ | Clean Java-only structure |
| Documentation | ✅ | Comprehensive docs created |
| Compatibility | ✅ | iOS parity maintained |
| Testing | ⏳ | Awaiting device testing |

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test on physical Android device
2. **Connect**: Verify connection to Dahua camera
3. **Stream**: Check video stream quality
4. **PTZ**: Test camera control (if supported)
5. **Stress**: Test memory under load
6. **Multi**: Test multiple simultaneous streams

## ✨ Success Criteria

✅ **PASSED**:
- Java implementation complete
- Kotlin fully removed
- Documentation comprehensive
- Build configuration correct
- iOS compatibility maintained

⏳ **PENDING**:
- Device testing required
- Real camera connection needed

## 📝 Notes

### Development Environment
- macOS (as indicated by file paths)
- Flutter SDK installed
- Android SDK available
- Dahua camera accessible on network

### Known Limitations
- SDK requires physical device (no emulator support)
- Native libraries device-only
- Requires network access to camera
- PTZ depends on camera model

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Add ProGuard rules for release
- [ ] Add more PTZ commands
- [ ] Add snapshot capability
- [ ] Add video recording
- [ ] Add two-way audio
- [ ] Add playback of recordings
